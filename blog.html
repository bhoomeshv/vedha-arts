            <h2>Our certificate & online programs for 2024</h2>
            <p>A film school is an educational institution dedicated to 
                teaching aspects of filmmaking, including such subjects
                 as film production, film theory, digital media production, 
                 and screenwriting. Film history courses and hands-on technical 
                 training are usually incorporated into most film school curricula.
                  Technical training may include instruction in the use and operation
                  of cameras, lighting equipment, film or video editing equipment and
                  software, and other relevant equipment. Film schools may also include 
                  courses and training in such subjects as television production,
                   broadcasting, audio engineering, and animation</p>
                   <br>

                   <p>The formal teaching of film began with theory rather than practical 
                    technical training starting soon after the development of the filmmaking
                     process in the 1890s. Early film theorists were more interested in writing
                      essays on film theory than in teaching students in a classroom environment.
                       The Moscow Film School was founded in 1919 with Russian filmmakers including
                        Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Lev Kuleshov serving as faculty 
                        to disseminate their very distinct viewpoints on the purpose of film.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>The tradition of apprenticing up through a hierarchical system continues
                         to this day within film studios and in television in many technical positions 
                         such as gaffers, grips, camera operators, and even into post-production with
                          editing and color correction. Independent lower budget filmmaking in the 
                          post-war period using portable 16mm film cameras allowed filmmakers like 
                          John Cassavetes in the United States, along with members of the French 
                          New Wave and Italian Neorealism in Europe, to circumvent the classical system.</p>
                          <br>
                          <p>A film school may be part of an existing public or private college or 
                            university, or part of a privately owned for-profit institution. Depending 
                            on whether the curriculum of a film school meets its state's academic 
                            requirements for the conferral of a degree, completion of studies in a
                             film school may culminate in an undergraduate or graduate degree, or a
                              certificate of completion. Some institutions, both accredited and 
                              non-accredited, run shorter workshop and conservatory programs[5]
                               concurrent to longer degree courses.</p>
