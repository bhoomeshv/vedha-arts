                <p>A prop, or property, is any moveable item that can be seen on a film. It could be
                     a hat, gun, cushion, wine glass, lightsaber, carpet, kitchen unit, tree or aircraft.
                      Prop masters run the property department which makes, stores and transports the props
                       as well as preps the props for each day's shoot.</p>

                     directing, acting, scriptwriting, etc. Every filmmaker needs to learn the technical 
                     terms of any shot. I’ve also added here some basic terms you should know as I feel it 
                     will help you to communicate your vision better. </p>

                <p>What is sound recording in filmmaking?
                    What is sound recording in film?
                    It involves capturing various sound components, including dialogue, ambient noises, sound 
                    effects, and music during filming. These sound recordings become the foundation for creating
                     a rich and immersive auditory experience that enhances the film's storytelling and 
                     emotional impact.</p>
